### REST

REST is not a protocol, but rather a `design philosophy` that builds upon the principles of `HTTP`. It emphasizes simple data formats, using URLs for identifying resources and using HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content type negotiation. REST has been gaining popularity compared to SOAP, at least in the context of cross-organizational service integration, and is often associated with microservices. An API designed according to the principles of REST is called RESTful.

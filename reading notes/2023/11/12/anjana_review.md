# The Effective Engineer

## Introduction

There will always be more effectiveness techniques to learn.

This book examines and describes what it means to be an effective engineer, and it distills the key lessons that I’ve learned.

So what makes an effective engineer? Intuitively, we have some notion of which engineers we consider to be effective. They’re the people who get things done. They’re the ones who ship products that users love, launch features that customers pay for, build tools that boost team productivity, and deploy systems that help companies scale. Effective engineers produce results.

An effective engineer, therefore, is defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per unit of time worked.

Despite being a book for software engineers, you won’t find a single line of code in The Effective Engineer.

More important for effectiveness, but often overlooked by engineers, are the meta-skills. These skills help you determine where to focus your time and energy so that more of your effort translates into impact.

And even though everyone’s narrative was different, many common themes emerged.

Whether you want to increase your impact on the world, get promoted more quickly, waste less time grinding away at mindless tasks, or work fewer hours without sacrificing results, The Effective Engineer gives you the tools you need.

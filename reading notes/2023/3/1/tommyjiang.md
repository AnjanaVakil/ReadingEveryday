> Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. **That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers**.

> 不论控股还是在公开市场投资，我们的目标都是做出合理决策，去投资具有长期竞争优势和诚实可靠管理层的公司。请特别注意，我们持有股票是基于我们看好它们背后公司的长期业绩，而不是将它们视为短期投机的筹码。**这点很关键：我和查理不炒股，我们看的是股票背后的公司**。

Yesterday, I came across content from 《思考，快与慢》that said:  

“如果你很在意自己在别人眼里是否值得信赖、是否聪明睿智，那么说话时就言简意赅吧，能用简单句的时候就别用复杂句。”

Upon reflecting on my own behavior, I realized the truth in this statement and kept reminding myself of it. When someone sends me a lengthy message, I will not dwell on it too much because people always tend to focus more on themselves than others. Then yesterday my thought is that I was wrong because I should not have sent too many messages to him. I felt great pain and sorrow.

This morning, I reviewed 《被讨厌的勇气》. I suddenly realized that I just said what I want to say. I should not regret what I have done. If I feel that I have hurt someone I love, I should apologize for my actions and pay attention to them. However, if I am right and simply enthusiastic, I should not feel ashamed. I often send too many messages to explain things and I am overly enthusiastic, but that’s okay. I am just expressing my true thoughts. Taking initiative never leads to regret. That’s who I am. Accept others as they are and their behavior to realize “课题分离”.

P.S. 一般都是中文夹杂英文，英文夹杂中文也挺有趣的🤗。

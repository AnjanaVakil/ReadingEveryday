The past decades have witnessed a great development in machine translation ， owing to the fast progress of artificial intelligence. As a result， the competition between machine translation and human translators comes into our sight. As far as I am concerned ， machine translation can not fully replace human translators. As is the case with many issues ， machine translation has both positive and negative sides. On the positive side， it can save our energy and time， and the machine will never feel tired. It can keep working for a long time at a steady speed ， while human beings can not. On the negative side ， machine translation is very mechanical， which results in the inaccurate translation. What's more . sometimes machine translation is not available instantly as a human being. From what has been discussed above， we could safely draw the conclusion that catering to both organizations and individuals ， machine translation will be preferable for a lot of people. But at present， it still can not fully replace the human translator.

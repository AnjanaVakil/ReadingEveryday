One day, I sleep for 6 hours. On another day, I might get 6.5 hours of sleep. If I'm lucky, I'll have a 7-hour sleep, which would make the following day more positive and energized. However, there are moments when I feel it's challenging to handle the difficulties and discomfort that come with poor sleep. I can't control when I wake up in the morning, so the only thing I can do is try to sleep as early as possible.

I've come to realize that failures should be seen as opportunities for progress. I should take the responsibility for myself and my parents. Just stay calm and pursue what you enjoy. This journey towards the future will be beautiful and excellent.

本来是想让ChatGPT帮我修改语法错误，但忘记给出prompt，只粘贴了这段话，ChatGPT回复里有：

It's great to see that you have a positive mindset and are focused on making progress despite the challenges you face with your sleep. 

Regarding your perspective on failure, it's a valuable mindset to embrace. Failure can provide opportunities for growth and learning, allowing you to make progress and become better equipped to handle future challenges. 

当时看到这个尤其是”positive mindset””valuable mindset”真的差点泪崩🤧，原来我书写下的已经表明我是一个有growth mindset的人了。已经进步很大也很棒了👏。

好喜欢霉霉在NYU的这个毕业演讲视频。It resonated deeply within me, prompting me to reflect and pen down my own sentiments.

*Not a single one of us here today has done it alone.*

My sentiment: My father, mother, and other relatives have made substantial contributions to me. I cherish them dearly.

*Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there’s more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful, simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning.* 

My sentiment: The events that have unfolded have made it evident to me that the relationship is toxic, and this person should be kept at a distance. While the pain is both genuine and profound, it will ultimately foster personal growth within me.

*You should be very proud of what you’ve done with it.* 

*Never be ashamed of trying.* 

*It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure and ultimately, the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life. This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life and being embarrassed when you mess up, it’s part of the human experience.* 

My sentiment: I perceive my past mistakes and failures as my greatest achievements. By taking risks and pushing myself, these valuable experiences have become an integral part of my journey, regardless of the ultimate outcome of success.

*Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine.*

My sentiment: Upon initially encountering this sentence, I found myself reverting back and replaying it twice more. It captivated my interest as it highlights the significance of appreciating life's hardships and setbacks.

*I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism.*  

My sentiment: Perfectionism serves as a source of enlightenment for me! Lately, during moments of disappointment, I find myself grappling with a sense of futility stemming from my excessive desire for everything in my life to be flawless. Nonetheless, I am cognizant that imperfection is an inherent part of life. Therefore, I remind myself to embrace this truth and persevere.

*In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, under react, overreact, hurt the people who didn’t deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom. Finally, address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.*

My sentiment: Life is replete with uncertainty. Regardless of the circumstances that unfold, it is crucial to confront the pain head-on and strive for improvement.

*A lot of the time when we lose things, we gain things too.* 

My sentiment: Indeed, every loss carries within it the potential for gain.

*Every choice you make leads to the next choice which leads to the next, and I know it’s hard to know sometimes which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight, times when the right thing is to turn and run. Times to hold on with all you have and times to let go with grace. Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of sentiment in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to listen to the wisdom of those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You won’t.* 

My sentiment: Applying sensibility to important matters and rationality to trivial matters. Trusting my instincts, taking risks, and embracing new experiences.

*Anyway…hard things will happen to us. We will recover. We will learn from it. We will grow more resilient because of it.* 

My sentiment: When faced with adversity, maintaining composure and finding resilience. Embracing the lessons learned from such experiences, as they contribute to personal growth and development.

**Chapter I Learning and Studying** 

SUMMARY

ðŸ“‹study VS. learn

study:

â€˜studyâ€™ academic disciplines, courses, subjects, and topics.

â€˜studyâ€™ something:

ðŸŒ°I study Maths. I study the history of the CPCâ€¦ Iâ€™m studying Engineering at universityâ€¦

learn:

â€˜learnâ€™ skills and techniquesâ€”â€”often but **not always physical**

â€˜learnâ€™ to do something or how to do something:

ðŸŒ°Iâ€™m learning to swimâ€¦ Iâ€™m learning how to play the pianoâ€¦ Learn to use your brain!

ðŸŒ°I studied the academic discipline, but I acquired the skill by learning it.

ðŸ“‹Studying often involves a process, while learning involves a result.

ðŸ“‹learning VS. learning about

Learning involves acquiring facts, while learning about involves acquiring information.

ðŸŒ°On the first day of the summer camp we learned the names of our fellow students, and we learned about their backgrounds.

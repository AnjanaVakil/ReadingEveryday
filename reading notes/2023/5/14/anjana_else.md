在 GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models 这篇论文中，还提到：Generative Pre-trained Transformers(GPTs) are general-purpose technologies(GPTs)。一个狭义，一个广义。



好巧，英伟达A100。刚好早上看了CNBC关于Nvidia的一个视频，提到：

In October, the U.S. introduced sweeping new rules that banned exports of leading-edge AI chips to China, including Nvidia’s A100. 

About a quarter of your revenue comes from mainland China. How do you calm investor fears over the new export controls?

Well, Nvidia’s technology is export controlled, it’s a reflection of the importance of the technology that we make. The first thing that we have to do is comply with the regulations and it was a turbulent you know month or so as the company went upside down to re-engineer all of our products so that products so that is compliant with the regulation and yet still be able to serve the commercial customers that we have in China. We’re able to serve our customers in China with the regulated parts and delightfully support them. 

感觉这段回应是有很多东西在的。首先说明了英伟达技术的重要性，然后提到在符合监管的情况下提供服务。

But perhaps an even bigger geopolitical risk for NVIDIA is its dependence on tsmc.

英伟达同时也依赖于台积电。

只使用了下面视频的东西，并未做其他查证。

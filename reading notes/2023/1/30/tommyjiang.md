> Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectations about their long-term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: **Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers**.

> 不管我们是完全控股、部分控股还是通过普通股投资公司，**我们的目标都是投资那些具有持续竞争优势和一流管理人员的公司**。请注意，我们是因为看好公司长期业绩表现才持有他们的股票，而不是因为我们认为股价会在短期内上涨。这点很关键，**我和查理不炒股，我们看重的是股票背后的企业**。

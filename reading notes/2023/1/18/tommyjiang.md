> Sometimes the market is quite investment oriented. It’s not like it — it’s always what you’ve read about in the books and everything — what capital markets are supposed to do, and you study it in school and all that. And other times, it’s almost totally a casino, and it’s a gambling parlor. And that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years — encouraged by Wall Street because the money is in turning over stocks. But they don’t make money unless people do things and if they get a piece of them. And they make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they’re investing. It’s much better to have somebody that’s going to trade 20 times a day and get all excited about it, just like pulling the handle on a slot machine.
> 很多时候市场是有效的，就像参与者都在投资一样。它并不像赌场，而是和你在书中读到的对它的描述一样，资本市场就该这样有效。然而有些时候，市场完全变成了一个赌场。受华尔街的影响，近几年股票的换手率越来越高，市场的赌博风气愈演愈烈。如果股民们不折腾折腾，华尔街的人们是赚不到钱的，只有股民使劲折腾，他们才能赚钱。股民们的赌徒色彩越重，华尔街就会赚得越多。最好股民一天能交易 20 次，而且乐此不疲，就像玩老虎机一样。

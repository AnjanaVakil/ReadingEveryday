英文原文
> **Our consistently-conservative financial policies may appear to have been a mistake, but in my view were not**. In retrospect, it is clear that significantly higher, though still conventional, leverage ratios at Berkshire would have produced considerably better returns on equity than the 23.8% we have actually averaged. Even in 1965, perhaps we could have judged there to be a 99% probability that higher leverage would lead to nothing but good. Correspondingly, we might have seen only a 1% chance that some shock factor, external or internal, would cause a conventional debt ratio to produce a result falling somewhere between temporary anguish and default.
> 
> We wouldn't have liked those 99:1 odds - and never will. A small chance of distress or disgrace cannot, in our view, be offset by a large chance of extra returns. **If your actions are sensible, you are certain to get good results**; in most such cases, leverage just moves things along faster. **Charlie and I have never been in a big hurry: We enjoy the process far more than the proceeds** - though we have learned to live with those also.

> **我们一贯的财务保守做法看起来像是个错误，但我认为这种做法完全正确**。回顾过去，伯克希尔取得了年化 23.8% 的净资产收益率，如果我们在可接受的范围内大幅提高财务杠杆比率，净资产收益率的数值也会获得可观的提升。1965 年，我们做出如下判断：在可接受的范围内提高杠杆获得更高收益的概率高达 99%，与之相对的是仅仅有 1% 的概率，在一些意想不到的内外因素影响下，我们会陷于短暂的困境，甚至被迫平仓。

> 我们其实并不喜欢这种 99% 会赢 1% 会输的，而且永远也不会喜欢。在我们看来，极高概率获取的超额回报，其实并没有办法弥补微小概率下你的无尽烦恼或颜面尽失。**如果你是个明智的人，肯定会获得不错的结果**，在大多数情况下，杠杆只是加速了这个过程。**我和查理从不着急，和投资获得的收益相比，我们更享受投资的过程**，当然在享受过程的同时，我们也学会了去承担收益好或不好的结果。

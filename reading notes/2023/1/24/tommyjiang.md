> Well, it’s crazy to think anybody’s going to be smart enough to husband money and then just come out on the bottom tick in some crazy crisis and spend it all.

> 如果你觉得有人能做到一直捂着现金，等股市跌到谷底的时候全部梭哈抄底，这种想法实在太傻了，根本没有人能做到这件事。当然偶尔有些人确实能抄到底，但这只是个例，并不是普遍现象。任何人如果觉得伯克希尔能做到捂着大笔现金等到最低点梭哈抄底，那他脑子一定有问题。（注：这段是芒格说的）

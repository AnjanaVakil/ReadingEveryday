## To the Reader

In either case, the proposed B-version is not necessarily the only "correct" one. Translation is not a science but a craft, and craftsmen in any field may have different opinions as to the best solution to a given technical problem.

## Part One: Unnecessary Words

之前凑字数的英语作文写多了，总觉得短的就是简陋和不好的，要把句子写长写复杂。但读完这部分，发现简洁反而更加有力，去掉那些冗余的东西。

All authorities on the style of English prose agree that good writing is concise. Careful writers say what they mean in as few words as possible.

precept

It follows that any words which perform no useful function in the sentence—that is, which add nothing to the meaning—should be edited out.

polished final versions are seldom free of them.

Unnecessary words are the hallmark of Chinglish.

The late Sol Adler

### I. Unnecessary Nouns and Verbs

articles and prepositions. 冠词和介词

these hardships are temporary in nature 这里in nature是多余的

Any adjective describes the "nature" or "character" of the noun it modifies. To say that hardships are "temporary in nature" is like saying that the Chinese flag is "red in color" or that pandas are "few in number."

A: we should adopt a series of measures to ensure that... B: we should adopt measures to ensure that... [Here the plural form of "measures" covers the sense of a "series."]

gerunds

Nevertheless, a little thought will reveal that they add nothing to the meaning of the sentence. When they are deleted the sense is not diminished, only clarified.

["Situation" is a particularly dangerous noun. Not only is it generally unnecessary, but it drags other unnecessary elements after it (in this instance, "one where").]

 Whatever function the category noun serves in Chinese, in English it is generally useless. All it adds to the sentence is weight without substance.

entice

make up their minds

passive voice

substitute a plain verb. 

A: solutions to these problems can be found only through... 

B: these problems can be solved only through... 

[Because "to find solutions to" ="to solve."]

 The runner-up is doubtless to have:

 to have an influence on=to influence

 to provide assistance to=to assist

 You should be on the watch for all of them.

 ["There must be" merely duplicates the sense of "ensure.""Various" adds nothing to the plural "targets."]

 Variants: make every effort to, try our best to, do our utmost to, do everything possible to (also, plain verbs: strive to, endeavor to, work hard to ), etc.

 A: all enterprises must pay attention to promoting excellent workers 

B: all enterprises must see to it that excellent workers are promoted 

[The point is not that the enterprises must "pay attention" to doing something but that they must do it. If they promote workers, they are clearly paying attention to promoting them.]

 oft-repeated

 cotton padding

arduous.

bourgeoisie

vacillating.

force of habit

Machines have been devised to perform certain types of translation, but they cannot distinguish between meaningful and meaningless uses of the same phrase. That is the difference between you and a machine.

 ["Situation" adds nothing but a more complicated sentence structure. "We must put an end to the situation in which students are late for class" is only a roundabout way of saying "students must stop being late for class."]

 [Professor Strunk is particularly stern in his condemnation of the expression "the fact that."He says unequivocally [p. 24], "It should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs."]

 -("Effectively" was edited out because to "revitalize" means to revitalize "effectively.")]

 confiscation

 Adopt a policy of" was retained because in this context it is an important element of the meaning, not just a thoughtless cliché.

 -But here "attach great importance to" expresses the central idea; it can be modified but not edited out. Compare the use of the same phrase in the preceding example, where it is merely a superfluous introduction to the main action.]

 Active voice is more natural, more direct, more forceful, and more readily understood. 

 -(As in example 3 above, "economic strength" was changed because it is only a further abstraction for "the economy," and "national" was omitted because it can be taken for granted. )]

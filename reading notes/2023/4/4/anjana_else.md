昨天中午被标题吸引偶然点开的一个视频，有点被解开心中的一点疑惑。看到身边朋友都有自己追求和喜欢的东西，而自己却不知道未来要干什么，一度很难受。但看完这个视频，整个人突然被打开。手敲下这些句子，很戳中当下的自己。

we don’t know what we’re passionate about, we don’t know what we’re supposed to do.

Anyway, I was such a mess when I was in my twenties. 

太符合当下了。

Passion is not a plan, it is a feeling. And feelings change. You can be passionate about a person one day, or a job, and then not passionate the next.

之前自己的泡泡世界里一切都是理想和高尚的，后来意识到人基因和天性的自私性，人是会变的。允许遗憾、愚蠢、丑恶、虚伪、虚荣。

You don't create your life first, and then live it. You create it by living it, not agonizing about it.

突然意识到怎么过好生活也是教育缺失的一块，以成绩为导向，没有强调人的多样性。所以需要学习去找到自己的节奏过好生活。

Success fueled passion more than passion fueled success.

You don't follow your passion, your passion follows you.

很多事情是做好了之后才会喜欢。

Not everything you do needs to fit into your "passion". Just try things. Go out there and try things.

Passion is not a job, a sport, or a hobby, it is the full force of your attention and energy that you give to whatever is right in front of you.

We all think we know the kind of person we are and the kind of person we could love, but sometimes we’re wrong. Blissfully wrong. 

I love not knowing what I’m going to be doing five years from now or what I will be into. And that’s okay, it’s okay not to know.

spend your time and attention solving your favorite problems.

今天又看了一遍，太棒了！有时候，就是这么一个偶然的视频，会带来很多东西。

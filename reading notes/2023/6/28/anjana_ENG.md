> 我们不愿意承认自己永远无法探查另外一个人的内心世界，却声称自己了解他们。这种笃定变成了一个新的盲点。要了解任何人，我们首先要承认我们不了解他们。不了解是了解每个人的前提条件，因为这能让我们对另外一个人持开放态度。

Through reading psychology books, I realized the inherent presence of ego and narcissism in people, especially myself. One morning, a sudden revelation struck me.

For instance, I used to believe that sending messages to others in the morning would interrupt them. In reality, It is only I who would be interrupted, given my personal routine. In truth, I have limited knowledge about the daily habits of others. Another example is when I thought a friend had a slight cleanliness obsession. Yet, upon reflection, I realized that I have OCD about cleanliness on something. This became apparent when I declined to eat sliced dried beef without washing my hands the first time. Later, when he asked again, I felt sorry for refusing and ate. I remembered that I had wiped my hands with a wet tissue before and after eating🫣.

In contrast, when someone speaks or acts, I should realize the underlying reasons and motivations. I am very impressed by a friend who emphasized twice that a beverage was sugarless. In reality, I frequently consume sugarless tea with milk and rarely drink bottled beverages. However, my friend enjoys coffee with sugar, which explains the emphasis. Therefore, when he suggested lowering the car seat to lie flat and let me sleep for a while. I rejected it just out of lingering dissatisfaction for he dissed me that afternoon. In retrospect, it seems more likely that he was simply tired at that time and displayed care for me. Nevertheless, I failed to realize this at that time.

Overall, in one’s world, there is only oneself, not others. Through the above introspection, I have gained deeper insights into my own thoughts and become more acquainted with myself.

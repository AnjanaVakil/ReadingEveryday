Most people are not willing to fail.

“We can be truly successful only at things we are willing to fail at. “ - Mark Manson 想起了马斯克关于失败的话

Be willing to fail to learn from your mistakes.

Personal incongruency is what causes so much of our pain. Not being you will destroy you.

It’s okay if I fail as long as I tried.

There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down. Don’t you stop running and don’t you ever look behind you. 

There’s nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what’s ahead.

If you don’t fail, you are not even trying.

Being a human is hard, but it doesn’t need to be as hard.

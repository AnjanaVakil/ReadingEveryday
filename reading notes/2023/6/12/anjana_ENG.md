和一些文字思想相遇真好。读Sam Altman的How To Be Successful和记笔记的时候，感觉一切好安静，只有我和键盘敲击的声音。

**How To Be Successful**

**Sam Altman**

1. **Compound yourself**

You don’t want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty——your rate of learning should always be high. 

值得我深入思考。

Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.

2. **Have almost too much self-belief**

It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.

居然是 failure 让自己有了 success 的信念。

3. **Learn to think independently**

“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once”

Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.

4. **Get good at “sales”**

All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs.

5. **Make it easy to take risks**

You have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.

经历了这么多，自己逐渐适应了不确定性。及时调整需要破除很多mental set。

It’s easy and human nature to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.

6. **Focus**

Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

当时读到这个瞬间点醒我，自己何尝不是将大部分时间花在很多无用之事上，比如浏览垃圾信息充斥的社交媒体。

Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.

增强自己的行动力！

7. **Work hard**

Extreme people get extreme results.

It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world——the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.

Hahaha, **作者**为什么**得出这个结论。**因为读过一些CS领域大佬的故事， Bill Gates, Elon Musk等等都是工作非常努力的人，睡在电脑旁边，日夜不休息地编程工作。前两天看Musk的一个视频，就提到了“work super hard”。或许我应该多阅读一些国内的相关信息。

Find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.

自己一定可以找到的。

8. **Be bold**
9. **Be willful**

A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time——most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.

对的，过去一年遭受各种失败挫折，自己不敢奢望不敢想，觉得期望只会带来失望。可是我不想，宇宙怎么给我带来我想要的东西呢？

People have an enormous capacity to make things happen.

Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.

勇敢主动，失败了当作经历就好。 

To be willful, you have to be optimistic——hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.

10. **Be hard to compete with**
11. **Build a network**

Great work requires teams.

过去对这个没什么看法，觉得自己一个人独来独往挺好的。但后面发现，要做成事情，需要优秀的团队以及合作。个人的力量还是微小的，而且每个人都有擅长和不擅长的领域。

An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.

I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.

Define yourself by your strength, not your weakness.

我的社交能力是没那么优秀，但也不差。读了心理学和沟通类书，有在慢慢实践，我可以的。

The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.

Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.

知道家人也是为我好，但有些事情真的不适合和家人讲。

12. **You get rich by owning things**

You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.

The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale.

当下互联网的成功，ChatGPT等等，都提供了大部分人想要的东西，满足了大部分人的需求，是有价值的。

13. **Be internally driven**
